        <p>The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposal for “One Nation, One Election” as recommended by a high-level committee headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind.

            On Tuesday, while addressing a press conference marking 100 days of the third term of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had asserted that “One Nation, One Election will be implemented in the term of this government”.

            Shah had reiterated the BJPs commitment towards simultaneous elections, which has been a manifesto promise of the party in the last three Lok Sabha polls.</p>

        This requires constitutional amendments but, as a first step, to hold the Lok Sabha and state elections together, a ratification by states will not be required for the amendments, once it is approved by Parliament.

In the second step, elections to the municipalities and panchayats will be synchronised with elections to the Lok Sabha and Assemblies in such a way that the local body elections are held within 100 days of the elections to the Lok Sabha and Assemblies. This will require ratification by not less than one-half of the states.

        <b>The BJP, which won </b>240 seats, relies on its allies including the TDP, Janata Dal (United), and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) for its majority. Questions have been raised about their support to the simultaneous elections plan but the BJP camp says that all these allies are on board and “arithmetic” would not get in the way of this “reform process”.
